    <h1>Beef Papaitan</h1>

    <p>Papaitan is one of the popular Ilokano dishes and the original recipe calls for goat innards. The reason why it is called “papaitan” is because the dish is bitter by using goat bile as one of the ingredient but just enough to make it tasty. Since goat innards are not always available in the market, you can substitute it with beef innards like this recipe I have here, the beef papaitan. Add the red chili and pour the the bile little by little.</p>
    <p>Cooking papaitan baka or beef papaitan requires an extra step of cleaning the innards. You have to rub and squeeze it with banana leaves to remove the musky odor. Then after that step, boil the innards until tender and afterwards cut it into small cubes. Then saute some aromatics like ginger, garlic and onions then add the beef innards. Stir fry the innards and season with salt and pepper. Then add some water, bring to a boil then add the beef tenderloin then simmer until the tenderloin is cooked. Then add the red chili peppers and pour the bile little by little. Season with patis then serve hot.</p>
    <p>This recipe is adapted and is more of what I grew up with after my sister and I didn't take a liking to the traditional way this dish is made</p>
